## SECURING RHEL WITH SELINUX ##

# Understanding the Need for SELinux

# Linux security is built on UNIX security 

# UNIX security consists of different solutions that were never developed with current IT security needs in mind.

# Most of these solutions focux on a part of the operating system.

# SELinux provides a complete and mandatory security solution. 

# The principle is that if it is not specifically allowed, it will be denied.

# As a result, "unknown" services will always need additional configuration to enable them in an environment where SELinux is enabled. 

# Known services work well with the standard SELinux configuration.
