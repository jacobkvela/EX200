## UNDERSTANDING SYSTEM TUNING ##

# Kernel tunables are provided through the /proc/sys directory in the /proc pseudo file system.

# Different files in the /proc/sys directory contain the current setting as its value.

# Change the current value with "echo >"
	
	* example : 
	"$ cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness" to see the current value 
	
	and 
	
	* "$ echo 40 > /proc/sys/vm/swappiness" to change the value to 40.

# To make settings persistent, write them to a file in /etc/sysctl.d

	* example: 
	"$ cat >> swappiness.conf << EOF
	vm.swappiness=40
	EOF"

## UNDERSTANDING TUNED ## 

# To make system tuning easier, tuned is provided.

# "tuned" is a systemd service that works with different profiles.	

# "$ tuned-adm list" shows current profiles

# "$ tuned-adm profile virtual-guest" sets another profile as default.

# Each profile contains a file with the name tuned.conf, that has a wide range of performance related settings.

# " The "reapply_sysctl = 1" parameter in /etc/tuned/tuned-main.conf ensures that in case of conflict, the sysctl parameter wins. 

## CREATING CUSTOM PROFILES ##

# Custom "tuned" profiles are stored as directories in /etc/tuned.

# Each profile should have a file "tuned.conf", containing the requested performance settings.
