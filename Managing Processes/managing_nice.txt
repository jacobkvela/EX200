## MANAGING NICE ##

# If no spcific Cgroups are defined, Linux "nice" and "renice" can be used to define CPU priority.

# To change priorities of non-realtime processes, the "nice" and "renice" commands can be used.

# Nice values range from -20 up to 19.

# Negative "nice" values indicates an increased priority, a positive "nice" value indicates decreased priority.

# Users can set their process to a lower priority; to increase priority users need root access.
	* example: "$ nice -n 19 dd if=/dev/zero of=dev/null"

# Priority is always relative to other processes.
