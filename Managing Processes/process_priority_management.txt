## UNDERSTANDING PROCESS PRIORITY MANAGEMENT ##

# Linux Cgroups provide a framework to apply resource restrictions to linux systems.

# Cgroups can limit the amount of CPU cycles, available memory, and more.

# If processes are equal from a prospective of Cgroups, the Linux "nice" and "renice" commands can be used to manage priority.

## UNDERSTANDING Cgroups ##

# In Cgroups, the Linux system is divided into 3 slices
	* System: all systemd processes
	* User: all user processes
	* Machine: virtual machines and containers
# Each slice has an equal CPU weight.

# If one or more processes within a slice request a maxium amount of CPU cycles, each slice will get an equal amount of CPU shares.
	* 20 systemd processes together gets as much as one user process that claims full CPU usage!

# In systemd, the CPUWeight can be set on individual systemd units.
