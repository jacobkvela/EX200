## UNDERSTANDING LOGROTATE ##

#  The "logrotate" command is started by a systemd timer to prevent log files from growing too big.

# After rotation, the file is renamed to a file with the rotation date as extension.

# When too many files are rotated, according to the settings, the oldest file will be discarded. 

# Log rotation is configured in files in /etc/logrotate.conf and /etc/logrotate.d/.
