## PERSERVING THE SYSTEMd JOURNAL ##

# Systemd journal settings are in /usr/lib/systemd/journal.conf.

# The setting "Storage=auto" ensures that persistent storage is happening automatically after creating the directory /var/log/journal.

# Other options are:
	* "persistent": stores journals in /var/log/journal.
	* "volatile": stores journals in the temporary /run/log/journal directory.
	* "none": doesn't use any storage for the journal at all.

# MANAGING PERSISTENT JOURNAL SIZE 

# In "journal.conf", default settings apply to ensure that the journal can't grow in an unlimitied way,
	* Log rotation triggers monthly
	* No more than 10& of the file system size can be used
	* No more than 15% of the file system free size can be used

# Use "journalctl | grep -E 'Runtime Journal | System Journal' to check current settings"

# DEMO: MAKING THE JOURNAL PERSISTENT

# "$ grep 'Storage=' /usr/lib/systemd/journal.conf"

# "$ mkdir /var/log/journal"

# "$ systemctl restart systemd-journal-flush.service"

# "$ ls /var/log/journal"
