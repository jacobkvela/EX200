## UNDERSTANDING RSYSLOGd ##

# Rsyslog needs rsyslogd service to be running.

# The main configuration file is /etc/rsyslog.conf.

# Drop-in files can be placed in /etc/rsyslog.d/.

# Each logger line contains three items,
	*"facility": the specific facility that the log is created for
	*"severity": the severity from which should be logged
	*"destination": the file or other destination the log should be written to

# Log files normally are in /var/log.

# UNDERSTANDING FACILITIES

# "rsyslog" is and must be backwards compatible with the ancient syslog service.

# In syslog, a fixed number of facilities was defined, like kern, authpriv, cron, and more.

# To work with services that don't have their own facility local{0..7} can be used.
