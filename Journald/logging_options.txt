 ## LOGGING OPTIONS ##

# systemd-journald is receiving log messages from different locations:
	* The kernel
	* Early boot procedure
	* Syslog events
	* Standard output and error from daemons

# The systemd journal is non-persistent by default

# The "rsyslog" service reads syslog messages and writes them to different locations:
	* Files in /var/log
	* According to output modules

# Services may also write to /var/log.
