# Configuring the Installation Disk as a Repo

# This procedure is NOT required on the exam. 

# Use the "dd" command to create an image of the boot dvd

example: dd if=/dev/sr* of=/rhel.iso bs=1M

# Make a directory to mount the iso to

example: mkdir /repo

# Create a backup of /etc/fstab as a safety measure

example: cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.bak

# Use "echo" and shell redirection ">>" to append a new entry to /etc/fstab

example: echo "/rhel.iso /repo iso9660 defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab

# Mount the directory 

example: mount -a
