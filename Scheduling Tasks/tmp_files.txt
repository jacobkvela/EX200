## MANAGING TMP FILES ##

# In the past, temporary files were created in the /tmp directory.

# Without management, these files could stay around for a long time.

# As a solution, the /tmp directory coule b ecreated on a RAM drive.

# Nowadays, "systemd-tmpfiles" is started while booting, and manages temporary files and directories.

# Functionality has been expanded to manage other files also.

# It will create and delete tmp files automatically, according to the configuration files in the following locations:
	* /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/
	* /etc/tmpfiles.d/
	* /run/tmpfiles.d/

# UNDERSTATIND "systemd-tmpfiles"

# "systemd-tmpfiles" works with related services to manage temporary files.

# "systemd-tempfiles-setup.service" creates and removes temporary files according to the configuration.

# "systemd-tmpfiles-clean.timer" calls the "systemd-tmpfiles-clean.service" to remove temporary files.
	* By default 15 minutes after booting
	* And also on a daily basis

# In the configuration files /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/ and /etc/tmpfiles.d/, specify what to do with temporary files.
	* "$ d /run/myfiles 0750 root root -" will create the directory /run/myfiles if necessary. No action if it already exists.
	* "$ D /run/myfiles 0750 root root 1d" will create the directory if necessary, and wipe its contents if it already exists. Files older than 1 day are eligible for automatic removal the next time systemd-tmpfiles runs.

# "$ man tmpfiles.d" provides detailed information and examples.
