## SCHEDULING TASKS WITH SYSTEMd TIMERS ##

# UNDERSTANDING SYSTEMd TIMERS 

# Systemd provies unit.timers files that go together with unit.service files to schedule the service file.

# When using systemd timers, the timer should be enabled/started, and NOT the service unit.

# Systemd timers are often installed from RPM packages.

# In the timer unit file, the "OnCalendar" option specifies when the service should be started.

# Since RHEL 9, systemd timers are the default way for scheduling recurring services.

# Systemd provides several simple presets you can use directly:

# Every minute
	example: OnCalendar=minutely

# Every hour
	example: OnCalendar=hourly
	
# Every day at midnight
	example: OnCalender=daily

# Every Monday at 00:00
	example: OnCalendar=weekly

# Every first day of the month at 00:00
	example: OnCalendar=monthly

# January 1st at 00:00
	example: OnCalendar=yearly / annually 

# The first day of January, April, July, October at 00:00
	example: OnCalendar=quarterly

# Use "OnUnitActivateSec" to start the unit at a specific time after the unit was last activated.

# Use "OnBootSec" or "OnStartUpSec" to start the unit at a specific time after system boot.

# Read "man 7 systemd.time" for specification of the time format to be used.

# EDITING SYSTEMd TIMERS (AND OTHER UNITS)

# To verify current settings, use "$ systemctl cat unit.type"

# To edit settings, use "$ systemctl edit unit.type"
	* This will create a drop-in file in /etc/systemd/system/unit.type.d/

# To ensure that systemd loads the changes, use "$ systemctl daemon-reload"
