## UNDERSTANDING CRON ##

# Cron uses "crond", a daemon that checks its configuration to run cron jobs periodically.

# On RHEL 10, "crond" is enabled as a systemd service by default.

# Most services that need scheduling are scheduled through systemd timers.

# The "crond" process checks it configuration every minute.

# "/etc/crontab/" is the main (managed) configuration file.

# "/etc/crontab.d/" can be used for drop-in files.

# "/etc/cron.{hourly,daily,weekly,monthly}" can be used as a drop-in for scripts that need to be scheduled on a regular basis.
	* Ensure that scripts have the execute bit set

# User-specific cron jobs can be created using "$ crontab -e"

# UNDERSTANDING CRON TIME SPECIFICATION

# Cron time specifications are specified as minute, hour, day of month, day of week. 

# "0 * * jan 1-5" will run a cron job every Monday through Friday on minute zero in January.

# The /etc/crontab file contains a syntax example.

# DO NOT EDIT /etc/crontab, instead put drop-in files in /etc/crontab.d 

# UNDERSTANDING ANACRON

# "anacron" is the service behind "cron" that ensures that jobs are executed on a regular basis, but not at a specific time.

# "anacron" takes care of jobs in /etc/cron.{hourly,daily,weekly,monthly}.

# Configuration is in /etc/anacrontab.

# HINT: Do not use "anacron", instead use systemd timers.
