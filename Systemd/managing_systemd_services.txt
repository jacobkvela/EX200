## MANAGING SYSTEMd SERVICES ##

# Use "$ systemctl status" to get current status

# "$ systemctl start" will start a unit that is not currently active.

# "$ systemctl stop" will stop the unit.

# "$ systemctl enable --now" is used to flag the unit for automatic starting upon system start. 

# "$ systemctl disable --now" is used to flag the unit to be no longer automatically started.

# "$ systemctl restart" restarts the unit, which is useful to have a service pick up changed configuration.
