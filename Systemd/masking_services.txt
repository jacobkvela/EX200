## MASKING SERVICES ##

# Some units cannot work simultaneously on the same system.

# To prevent administrators from accidentally starting these units, use "$ systemctl mask" 

# "$ systemctl mask" links a unit to the /dev/null device, which ensures it cannot be started.

# "$ systemctl unmask" removes the unit mask"
