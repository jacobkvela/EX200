## UNDERSTANDING GTP AND MBR PARTITIONS

# Master Boot Record (MBR) is part of the 1981 PC specification
	* 512-bytes to store boot information
	* of which 64-bytes to store partitions
	* Place for 4 partitions only with a max size of 2TiB
	* To use more partitions, extended and logical partitions must be used
	* On modern systems, there is no more need to use MBR anymore

# GUID Partition Table (GPT) was introduced in 2010 to overcome MBR limitations
	* More space to store partitions (32 sectores instead of 64-bytes)
	* 128 partitions max
	* Addresses disks bigger than 2TiB (8Zib max - approx. 9 billion GiB)
