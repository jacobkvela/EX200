## UNDERSTANDING STRATIS ##

# Stratis is adding volume management capacities as a seperate layer to the XFS filesystem.

# Stratis volumes always use the XFS filesystem.

# Stratis volumes are thin provisioned by nature.

# Volume storage is allocated from the stratis pool.

# Each stratis volume needs a minimal size of 4GiB.

# Because of the thin provisioning, stratis tools must be used to monitor available storage space.

# MANAGING STRATIS 

# To work with stratism you'll need the "stratisd" and "stratis-cli" packages.

# Use the "$ stratis" command to create pools and filesystems.

# This command has awesome tab completion.

# While working with stratis, use "$ stratis pool list" to ensure the pool has sufficient space remaining.

# To mount stratis volumes:
	* Use UUID
	* Include "x-systemd.requires=stratis.service" as a mount option.

# UNDERSTANDING STRATIS SNAPSHOTS

# A stratis snapshot is a metadata copy that allows you to access the state of the snapshot at any time.

# A snapshot is NOT a backup, but can be helpful in accessing deleted files.

# A snapshot is mounted by its device name, not by UUID.
