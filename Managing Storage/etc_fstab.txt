## UNDERSTANDING /ETC/FSTAB ##

# /etc/fstab is the main configuration file to persistently mount partitions
	* /dev/nvme0n1p4	/data	ext4	defaults 0 0

# /etc/fstab content is used to generate systemd mounts by the "systemd-fstab-generator" utility.

# To update systemd mounts, it is recommended to use "$ systemctl daemod-reload" after editing /etc/fstab.

# AVOIDING PROBLEMS WHILE BOOTING

# If an error was found in /etc/fstab, your system will drop a troubleshooting shell while booting.

# After adding lines to /etc/fstab, use "$ mount -a" to mount all that hasn't been mounted yet.

# Alternatively, use "$ findmnt --verify" to verify syntax.
