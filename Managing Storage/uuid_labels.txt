## UUID AND LABELS ##

# In datacenters environments, block device names may change. Different solutions exist for persistent naming.

# UUID: a UUID is automatically generated for each device that contains a filesystem or anything similar.

# Labels: while creating the filesystem, the option "-L" can be used to set an arbitary name that can be used for mounting the filesystem.

# Unique device names are created in /dev/disk/*

# MANAGING PERSISTENT NAMING ATTRIBUTES

# "$ blkid" shows all devices with their naming attributes

# "$ tune2fs -L" is used to set a label on an EXT filesystem.

# "$ xfs_admin -L" is used to set a label on an XFS filesystem.

# "$ mkfs.* -L" is used to set a label while creating the filesystem.
