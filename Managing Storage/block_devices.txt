## LINUX BLOCK DEVICES ##

# Depending on the driver that is used, different block devices may occur.

# Use "$ lsblk" to get an overview of currently existing devices. 

# /dev/nvmexny is used for NVME devices.

# /dev/sd(x) is common for SCSI and SATA disks.

# /dev/vd(x) is used in KVM virtual machines.

# UNDERSTANDING PARTITION NUMBERING

# On "sd" and "vd" devices, partitions are numbered in order:
	* /dev/sda2 is the second parition on first hard disk.
	* /dev/sba1 is the first partition on the second hard disk.

# On nvme devices, partition names are appended to the device name:
	* /dev/nvme0n1p1 is the first partition on the first hard disk.
	* /dev/nvme0n3p2 is the second partition on the third hard disk.

# Use "$ lsblk" to avoid confusion!
	* "$ lsblk" reads the kernel partition table in /proc/partitions.
