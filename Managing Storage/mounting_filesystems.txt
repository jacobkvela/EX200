## MOUNTING FILESYSTEMS ##

# After making the filesystem, you can mount it in runtime using the "$ mount" command.
	* "$ mount /dev/nvme0n1p4 /mnt"

# Use "$ umount" before disconnecting a device.
	* Use "$ lsof /mnt" if you get an error about open files.

# The "$ mount" command shows all mounted filesystems, including administrative kernel mounts.

# The "$ findmnt" command shows which filesystem is mounted where in the directory structure.

# "$ lsblk" is probably the easiest tool to get an overview of which partitions are mounted where.
