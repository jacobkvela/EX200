## CREATING AND MOUNTING FILESYSTEMS ##

# XFS is the default filesystem
	* Fast and scalable 
	* Uses CoW to guarantee data integrity
	* Size can be increased, not decreased

# Ext4 was default in RHEL 6 and is still available
	* Backwards compatible to Ext2
	* Uses journal to guarantee data integrity
	* Size can be increased and decreased 

# vfat offers multi-OS support
	* Used for shared devices and UEFI partition

# Btrfs is a new and advanced filesystem
	* Considered not stable enough by Red Hat 

# CREATING FILESYSTEMS

# "$ mkfs.xfs" creates an XFS filesystem.

# "$ mkfs.ext4" creates an Ext4 filesystem.

# "$ mkfs.vfat" creates a vfat filesystem.

# "$ mkfs.[Tab][Tab]" to show a list of available filesystems.

# Do NOT use "$ mkfs" as it will create an Ext2 filesystem!
