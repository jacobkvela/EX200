## MANAGING SWAP ##

# Swap is RAM that is emulated on disk.

# All Linux systems should have at least some swap.
	* If there is a memory shortage, unused application memory can be moved to swap
	* The amount of swap depends on the use of the sever.

# Swap can be recreated on any block device, including swap files.

# Set partition type to linux-swap.

# After creating the swap partition, use "$ mkswap" to create the swap filesystem.

# Activate swap using "$ swapon"
