## UNDERSTANDING DISK LAYOUT ##

# Disk Layout

# From the UEFI, the boot disk is assigned.

# On the boot disk, the first 1MiB is reserved for metadata.

# Historically, the Master Boot Record (MBR) is the first 512-byte sector and was used for booting.

# Nowadays, the firmware addresses the UEFI boot partition, and the MBR only contains the protective MBR.

# The protective MBR is for legacy applications and indicates that the disk is in use.

# Starting the second sector, the partition table is stored.

# Each partition entry needs 128-bytes, and with a total of 128 partitions that can be created, 32 sectors (16KiB) are used for storing the partition table.

# PARTITIONS 

# Partitions are the primary entities to allocate disk space.

# Each RHEL system must have partitions, as the UEFI boot partition is required in the boot procedure.

# Even if your server uses Logical Volume Manager (LVM), partitions are still required.

# Partitions have been around since the introduction of the PC in 1981.

# On each partition a filesystem is created to organize file storage.

# On Linux servers, it is common to work with multiple partitions to separate different types of files.

# Because they offer additional flexibility, local volumes may be used in addition to partitions.

# MANAGING PARTITIONS

# In most cases, partitions are created while installing a server, and different storage areas are mounted:
	* /boot/efi
	* /boot
	* /
	* /home (optional)
	* /var (optional)
	* swap space

# If additional disk devices are added later, or if virtual disks are increased in size, it might be required to manage partitions.
