## PARTITIONING TOOLS ##

# "$ fdisk" is the recommended utility and has been around since the earliest Linux versions.
	* Offers easy access to advanced features
	* Completely reworked to support MBR and GPT partitions
	* On new disks, create a GPT partition table using "g"; it creates a MBR partition table by default

# "$ gdisk" was introduced to offer GPT support but is no longer installed by default.

# "$ parted" was introduced to make partitioning easier.
	* Can be easily scripted

# PARTITION TYPES

# A partition type is a low-level identifier of the operating system, filesystem, and boot manager using a specific partition.

# Partition types were important in the past, currently partitions will work if wrong parition type is set.
	* In "$ fdisk", use "t" to change the parition type.

# Use Aliases to set the appropriate partition type:
	* Linux: standard linux
	* Swap: linux swap
	* UEFI: uefi boot
	* LVM: logical volume manager

# Other partition types are available, use "l" for a list.
